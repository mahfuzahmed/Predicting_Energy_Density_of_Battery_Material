1. data_cleaning ----- initial cleaning of data (divided each table into missing and cleaned)

2. data_pre_processing.py ----- created a column molecular weight based of the Extracted Name column (parsed it and used a dictionary to calculate the molecular mass of the given formulae of the compound)

3. data_combining_vertical.py ----- vertical integration of all the data (failed step)

4. data_merging_for_sql.py ----- tried to integrate them horizontally (failed step)

5. further_cleaning.py ----- actually did some cleaning, renamed columns , dropped non-essential columns, stored separately

6. find_distinct_compounds.py ----- created 5 CSVs each with distinct values by Compound name and molecular weight

7. distinct_data_merging.py ----- merged the distinct tables to get one final table

8. final_cleaning_steps.py ----- cleaned up the final tables, dropped conductivity column, dropped na values, dropped na rows
